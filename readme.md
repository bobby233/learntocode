# 新年快乐!   Happy Chinese New Year!
It is Chinese New Year these days. I will not update so quickly. But I will change this repository's name. It'll be 'learntocode'. And I will put some of my other coding project(HTML, C...) into it. Even hacking project!




# learntocode
There are my code learning project in this repository. There are many languages. Like Python, HTML, C and some else. Welcome you to learn here.
## python
Important: The author is a Chinese. But I want to use English.</br>
```` py
print('Hello!')
````
This is my Python learning repository. There are my Python projects in it. And I will update the projects weekly. If I am wrong in someplace, welcome to correct it.
### abs.py
V1.0.1</br>
This is a simple abs changer. It can change any number to abs.</br>
And the code is really easy:
````py
a = input('type in a number to change to abs:')
b = int(a)

if b >= 0:
    print(b)
else:
    print(-b)
````

### scoregrowthrate.py

This is a programme, but a tutorial. Please download it, it's very helpful.
